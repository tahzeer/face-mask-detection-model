# Face Mask Detection Model
Image Classification Model written in python which detects a face in an image using casscading models from OpenCV, performs processing using Keras & then detect whether the person has a facemask on. The model is built on the TensorFlow library in Google Colab Notebooks.

## Output
The classification result with its probability is printed on the original image using OpenCV.
