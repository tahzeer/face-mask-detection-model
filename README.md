# Face Mask Detection Model
Machine Learning Model written in python which detects a face in an image using casscading models from OpenCV, perform processing using Keras library & then detect whether the person has a facemask on. The model is built on the TensorFlow library in Google Colab Notebooks.

The model is sequential and optimized using Adam.

## Output
The output text is written on the original image using OpenCV.
